# Release Notes - R24.05

The 24.05 release includes updates and enhancements to the Catena-X ecosystem, focusing on enabling foundational functionality and supporting key use cases.

## Highlights
- **No Managed Identity Wallet (MIW)**: The Managed Identity Wallet was not included in this release due to incomplete functionality for the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) flow. Instead, the Decentralized Identity Management (DIM) Wallet was used.
- **Intermediate Solutions**:
    - Introduced the **SSI DIM Wallet Stub** to simulate wallet functionalities for testing purposes.
    - The IATP Mock was made available as an alternative solution but lacks comprehensive wallet functionality.
- **Predefined Subsets**: Introduced predefined subsets for:
    - Data Exchange
    - Portal
    - BPDM (Business Partner Data Management)

## Key Notes
- This release focuses on establishing foundational components and integrating key services for initial deployment.
- For wallet functionality in E2E adopter journeys, refer to the [SSI DIM Wallet Stub](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-dim-wallet-stub).
